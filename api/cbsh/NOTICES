3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent
license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise
transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims
licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to
which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation
against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to
You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or

    along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
    Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.
    The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do
    not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within
    Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the
    NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices
    cannot be construed as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the

applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in
writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or
rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You

name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version
of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works

no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent
license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise
transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims
licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to
which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation
against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to
You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or

    the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided
    along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
    Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.
    The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do
    not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within
    Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the
    NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices
    cannot be construed as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any

tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in
writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or
rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You
may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of
any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
liability.

---------------------------


CC0 1.0 Universal
-----------------

CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL
SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT
RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS.
CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE
INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES
RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
HEREUNDER.


Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship
and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to
the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of
creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater
distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work
(the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected
by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights").
Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
    and translate a Work;

  ii.  moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
    depicted in a Work;

  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject
    to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a
    Work;

  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
    European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
    protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
    including any amended or successor version of such directive); and

  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
    based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and
Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or
unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in
the Work

  i.  in all territories worldwide,

  ii.  for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including
    future time extensions),

  iii.  in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and

  iv.  for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
    advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver").

Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large
and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that
such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express
Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall
be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's
express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged
Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable,
non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to
exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work

  i.  in all territories worldwide,

  ii.  for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including
    future time extensions),

  iii.  in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and

  iv.  for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
    advertising or promotional purposes (the "License").

The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer
to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such
case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not

  i.  exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the
    Work or

  ii.  assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the
    Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.

  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of
    any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
    including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
    for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other
    defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
    discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.

  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that
    may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any
    person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
    disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or
    other rights required for any use of the Work.

  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party
    to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or
    use of the Work.

2. License Grants and Conditions
--------------------------------


  2.1. Grants

  Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
  license:

    a.

      under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
      Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify,
      display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions,
      either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger
      Work; and

    b.

      under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale,
      have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its
      Contributor Version.


  2.2. Effective Date

  The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become
  effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes
  such Contribution.


  2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

  The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this
  License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution
  or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding
  Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:

    a.

      for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

    b.

      for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
      modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
      Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
      Version); or

    c.

      under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its
      Contributions.

  This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or
  logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice
  requirements in Section 3.4).


  2.4. Subsequent Licenses

  No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute
  the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see
  Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the
  terms of Section 3.3).


  2.5. Representation

  Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are
  its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its
  Contributions conveyed by this License.


  2.6. Fair Use

  This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
  copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.


  2.7. Conditions

  Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
  Section 2.1.


3. Responsibilities
-------------------


  3.1. Distribution of Source Form

  All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
  Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
  terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of
  the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can
  obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the
  recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.


  3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

  If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

    a.

      such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as
      described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable
      Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable
      means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution
      to the recipient; and

    b.

      You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or
      sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the
      Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
      in the Source Code Form under this License.


  3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

  You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
  provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
  Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with
  a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is
  not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to
  additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary
  License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option,
  further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License
  or such Secondary License(s).


  3.4. Notices

  You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
  copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of
  liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software,
  except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy
  known factual inaccuracies.


  3.5. Application of Additional Terms

  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity
  or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
  However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any
  Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
  indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby
  agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such
  Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You
  offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of
  liability specific to any jurisdiction.


4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with
respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or
regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the
maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they
affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent
prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently
detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.


5. Termination
--------------

  5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
  fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then
  the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are
  reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and
  finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such
  Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means
  prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your
  grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such
  Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this
  is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
  from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your
  receipt of the notice.

  5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
  infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and
  cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly
  infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all
  Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall
  terminate.

  5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
  license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
  validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
  termination shall survive termination.


6. Disclaimer of Warranty
-------------------------

Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without
warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without
limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as
to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any
Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume
the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of
warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered
Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.


7. Limitation of Liability
--------------------------

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct,
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work
stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial
damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility
of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for
death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent
applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the
exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion
and limitation may not apply to You.


8. Litigation
-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a
jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and
such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference
to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a
party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.


9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against
a Contributor.


10. Versions of the License
---------------------------


  10.1. New Versions

  Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3,
  no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new
  versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version
  number.


  10.2. Effect of New Versions

  You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the
  License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the
  terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.


  10.3. Modified Versions

  If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a
  new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of
  this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of
  the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from
  this License).


  10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
  Licenses

  If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
  Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice
  described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.


Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice
-------------------------------------------

  This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License,
  v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file, You can
  obtain one at http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then
You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant
directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.


Exhibit B - "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses" Notice
---------------------------------------------------------

  This Source Code Form is "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses", as defined
  by the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.
